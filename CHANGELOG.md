Apolo 24.12.1 (2024-12-17)
==========================

# Apolo SDK/CLI 24.12.1 (2024-12-16)

### Features

- Balance is no longer stored on a cluster level, and was moved to an organization level, e.g.,
  to an org itself, and to an org users, instead of a cluster / cluster users.

  New commands:
	- `apolo admin set-org-defaults` - allows to set an organization default values, such as a default user credits

  Existing commands changes:
	- `apolo admin add-cluster-user` cmd is no longer accepting a `credits` argument.
	- `apolo admin set-user-credits` cmd is now expecting an org name instead of a cluster name.
	- `apolo admin add-user-credits` cmd is now expecting an org name instead of a cluster name.
	- `apolo admin set-org-cluster-credits` was removed in a favor of an `apolo admin set-org-credits`.
	- `apolo admin add-org-cluster-credits` was removed in a favor of an `apolo admin add-org-credits`. ([#3137](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-cli/issues/3137))

Neuro SDK/CLI 22.1.1 (2022-01-18)
=================================

Features
--------

- Add command `neuro acl list-roles` to list roles created by user. ([#2496](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2496))
- Added support to set/update cluster level default credits and quota.

  Use options `--default-credits` and `--default-jobs` of commands `neuro admin add-cluster`,
  `neuro admin update-cluster`, `neuro admin add-org-cluster` and `neuro admin update-org-cluster`
  to set and update cluster defaults. This values will when new user with role "user" is added to cluster
  (either by `neuro admin add-cluster-user` or if user registers himself using web interface).
  The default for managers and admins is unlimited quota and credits as the can edit their quota.

  You can override default value by using `--credits` and `--jobs` options of
  `neuro admin add-org-cluster` command. ([#2520](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2520))


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed memory leak in `neuro blob cp`. ([#2523](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2523))


Neuro Flow 22.1.0 (2022-01-26)
==============================

Features
--------

- Support `${{ matrix.ORDINAL }}` as unique 0-based index for selected rows.

  If a batch flow has a matrix, all matrix rows are enumerated.
  The ordinal number of each row is available as `${{ matrix.ORDINAL }}` system value. ([#693](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/693))
- Add support of expressions in matrix definition.

  You can now use expression to define list of matrix products. In examples here and below,
  both `old_way_key` and `new_way_key` produce same list of values:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: ["1", "2", "3"]
	new_way_key: ${{ ["1", "2", "3"] }}
  ```

  This can be helpful when used together with new `range()` function:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: [0, 1, 2, 3]
	new_way_key: ${{ range(4) }}
  ```

  The `range()` function supports same parameters as python's `range()`, but it returns list.
  For example: `${{ range(1, 4) }}` generates `[1,2,3]`, and `${{ range(4, 1, -1) }}` generates
  `[4,3,2]`.

  As sometimes plain numbers is not best options for matrix products, you can use list comprehension
  to perform some mapping:

  ```
  matrix:
	old_way_key: ["k1", "k2", "k3"]

Neuro_Extras 21.11.0 (2021-11-23)
=================================


Features
--------


- Allow to build and push docker images to the remote image registries.

  The requirement for allowing Kaniko (the underlying tool) to push such images - it should be authenticated.

  The registry authention data structure should be in the following form:
  `{"auths": {"<registry URI>": {"auth": "<base64 encoded '<username>:<password>' string"}}}`
  (tested with the `https://index.docker.io/v1/` - public DockerHub registry)

  `neuro-extras config build-registy-auth` command might become handy in this case.

  To attach the target registy AUTH data into the builder job, one might save it as the platform secret and mount into the builder job.
  Mounting of the secret could be done either as the ENV variable with the name preffixed by `NE_REGISTRY_AUTH`, or as the secret file.
  In the later case, the ENV variable should also be added with the mentioned above preffix and pointing to the corresponding file. ([#328](https://github.com/neuromation/neuro-extras/issues/328))

==========================

Neuro Flow 21.10.0 (2021-10-27)
===============================

Features
--------

- Added new context called git. It has following attributes:

  - ${{ git.sha }} -- SHA of current commit
  - ${{ git.branch }} - name of current branch
  - ${{ git.tags }} - list of tags that point to current commit

  This context is available everywhere both in live and batch mode, but it can only be used
  if project's workspace is inside some git repository. ([#603](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/603))
- Added ternary operator to expressions: `${{ left if condition else right }}` will evaluate to `left`
  if `condition` is True and to `right` otherwise. ([#605](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/605))
- Allowed ']]' and '}}' in yaml literal strings. ([#607](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/607))
- Added column with batch name to output of `neuro-flow bakes`. ([#618](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/618))
- Enabled detailed automatic logging to file. For locally executed commands, logs will
  go to `~/.neuro/logs` directory. Remote executor detailed logs will go to `storage:.flow/logs/<bake_id>/`. ([#622](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/622))
- Added support of non-string types for action inputs. Now, one can specify action input in following way:

  ```
  inputs:
	arg1:
	  descr: Input with implicit string type
	arg2:
	  descr: Input with explicit string type
	  type: str
	 arg2:
	  descr: Input with explicit int type and corresponding default
	  type: int
	  default: 42
  ```

  Supported types are `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`. On action calls side, it's now possible to use
  corresponding yaml types as arguments. ([#626](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/626))
- Added possibility to specify job/bake params via the shortcut `-p` for `--param`. ([#629](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/629))



Neuro 21.10.1 (2021-10-26)
==========================

- Added `neuro blob importbucket` command to import external bucket. External buckets support
  the same operations (`neuro blob ls/cp/rm/glob`), but it is impossible to generate persistent credentials
  for them using "neuro blob mkcredentials". ([#2297](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2297))
- Added `neuro blob sign-url <blob-uri>` command for generation of urls that grant temporal access to blob. ([#2299](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2299))
- Added command `neuro blob set-bucket-publicity <bucket> <"public"|"private">` to make bucket accessible for unauthorized
  users. ([#2306](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2306))
- Undeprecate `neuro job save` command, we decided to support this functionality in future. ([#2336](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2336))

Neuro SDK/CLI 21.8.30 (2021-08-30)
==================================

Features
--------

- Implement URI autocompletion for "blob:" scheme. ([#2273](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2273))
- Provide `pip install neuro-cli[awscli,boto3]` extra dependencies for installing the compatible AWS CLI version.

- Implement public URI helpers. ([#2253](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2253))
- Reworked blob storage support:

  Bucket management commands:
  - use `neuro blob mkbucket` to create new bucket
  - use `neuro blob lsbucket` to list your buckets
  - use `neuro blob statbucket <bucket_id>` to retrieve info about single bucket
  - use `neuro blob rmbucket <bucket_id>` to delete bucket. Note that you can only delete empty buckets.

  Users can name buckets objects. The name should be unique between users buckets and can be used
  instead of bucket id.

  Bucket contents management commands:
  - use `neuro blob ls blob:<bucket_id>/<path_in_bucket>` to list bucket contents. Option `-r`
  disables file system emulation and displays all keys that start with <path_in_bucket>.
  - use `neuro blob glob blob:<bucket_id>/<glob_pattern>` to glob search objects in buckets.
  For example, `blob:my_bucket/**/*.txt` pattern will match all `.txt` files in `my_bucket`
  bucket.
  - use `neuro blob cp <src_uri> <dst_uri>` to copy data from/to bucket.
  - use `neuro blob rm blob:<bucket_id>/<path_in_bucket>` to delete elements from bucket. ([#2258](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2258))
- Implement URI autocompletion for bash shell. ([#2259](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2259))
- Added way to create persistent credentials to buckets to use in outside of the platform:

  - use `neuro blob mkcredentials <bucket1_id> <bucket2_id> ...` to create new credentials for specified buckets
  - use `neuro blob lscredentials` to list your buckets credentials
  - use `neuro blob statcredentials <credentials_id>` to retrieve info about single bucket credentials
  - use `neuro blob rmbucket <credentials_id>` to delete bucket credentials.

  Users can name buckets credentials. The name should be unique between users buckets credentials and can be used
  instead of bucket credentials id. ([#2264](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2264))


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Deprecate `neuro run IMAGE CMD`, use `neuro run IMAGE -- CMD` instead. The same for `neuro exec` command. ([#2260](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2260))
- Remove deprecated options older than 6 months. ([#2262](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2262))

- Changed interpretatation of cluster related URIs (with schemes `storage:`, `image:` and `job:`) with missed host and path started with `/`. `storage:/user/path` is expanded now to `storage://{defaultcluster}/user/path`, so you do not need to specify the cluster name when refer to other user's resources on the same cluster. ([#1424](https://github.com/neuromation/platform-api-clients/issues/1424))

- Implement `neuro storage tree` command for displaying the directory tree on storage. ([#1435](https://github.com/neuromation/platform-api-clients/issues/1435))

- Filter patterns are now more compatible with `.gitignore`. Added support of `**` which matches zero or more path components. `?` and `*` no longer match `/`. Patterns which does not contain `/` at the beginning or middle matches now files in subdirectories. ([#1444](https://github.com/neuromation/platform-api-clients/issues/1444))

Neuro Flow 21.7.9 (2021-07-09)
==============================

Features
--------

- Added new sections `defaults`, `images`, `volumes` to the `project.yml` file. The work the same as the do in `live`/`batch` except they are global -- everything defined in `project.yml` applies to all workflows. (#506)


Neuro Flow 21.7.7 (2021-7-7)
============================

Features
--------


- Added modules feature: a module is simillar to action but has following differneces:
  - only local files support (`ws:` scheme), github located modules are forbidden.
  - the module content has access to workflow global defaults. The default env/volumes/preset
  is inherited, and expressions can access top level contexts such as `flow`.

  Calling a module is similar to calling an action, except for use of `module` property
  instead of `action` property:

  Live module call:
  ```
  jobs:
	test:
	  module: ws:live-module
	  args:
		arg1: val 1
  ```

  Batch module call:
  ```
  tasks:
	- id: test
	  module: ws:batch-module
	  args:
		arg1: val 1
  ``` ([#464](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/464))

- Add support of mixins in live and batch mode.

  Mixins allow to define and reuse some common parts of jobs in live mode and tasks in batch mode.
  To define a mixin, use top level `mixins` sections:
  ```
  ...
  mixins:
	credentials:
	  volumes:
		- secret:some_key:/var/some_key
	  env:
		KEY_LOCATION: /var/some_key
  ...
  ```

  Mixins can define the same properties as "job" and "task" do, except for "id" field in batch mode.
  To apply a mixin, use `inherits` property:

  ```
  ...
  jobs:
	test_a:
	  inherits: [ credentials ]
  ...
  ```

  When applied, all fields defined in mixin will be merged into job definition.
  You can apply multiple mixins simultaneously. If some of applied mixins share the same property,
  or/and it is defined in task, the following rules are applied:
  - If property is scalar (int/string/bool), then job will use value defined in job definition. If it is absent,
  the value from the rightmost of the mixins that define this property will be used:
  ```
  mixins:
	mix1:
	  image: example_mix1
	mix2:
	  image: example_mix2
  jobs:
	job1:
	  inherits: [mix1, mix2]
	  image: example
	job2:
	  inherits: [mix1, mix2]
  ```
  The `job1` will use `example` image, and `job2` will use `example_mix2` image.
  - If property is list, that all lists will be concatenated.
  - If property is dict, that rule for scalars will be applied for dict values separately.

  Mixins can inherit from each other:
  ```
  mixins:
	mix1:
	  env:
		TEST: 1
	mix2:
	  inherits: [ mix1 ]
	  image: example
  ``` ([#498](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/498))

Neuro Flow 21.5.19 (2021-05-19)
===============================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug with processing SKIPPED task


Neuro Flow 21.5.17 (2021-05-17)
===============================

Features
--------

- Neuro Flow now uses the dedicated Platform API to store the flow database. The storage is still supported but will be removed in a few months.

- Added new expressions functions:
  - `values(dict_instance)`: get values of dictionary (similar to python's `dict_instance.values()`)
  - `str(any)`: convert any object to string
  - `replace(string, old, new)`: replace all occurrences of `old` in `string` with `new`.
  - `join(separator, array)`: concatenate array of strings inserting `separator` in between. ([#357](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/357))

- Added support of default volumes similar to default env: both in live and batch modes, you can
  specify them under `defaults` section:
  ```
  defaults:
	volumes:
	  - storage:some/dir:/mnt/some/dir
	  - storage:some/another/dir:/mnt/some/another/dir
  ```
  - In live mode such volumes will be added to all jobs.
  - In batch mode such volumes will be added to all tasks.

  Default volumes are not passed to actions (same as default env). ([#359](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/359))

- Added passing of global options (`-v`, `-q`, `--show-traceback`) to neuro cli and executor. ([#360](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/360))

- Added `--dry-run` flag for `neuro-flow run` that enables prints job command instead of running it. ([#362](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/362))

- Added support of tagging bakes.

  To tag a bake:
  ```
  neuro bake --tag tag1 --tag tag2 batch_name
  ```
  To retrieve bakes by tags:
  ```
  neuro bakes --tag tag1
  ``` ([#382](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/382))


Bugfixes
--------

Neuro Flow 21.4.5 (2021-04-05)
==============================

Features
--------


- Mark cached task in `neuro-flow inspect <bake>` as "cached" instead of "succeeded". ([#318](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/318))

- Auto create parent directories in "upload()" expression function. ([#319](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/319))

- Add bake_id tag to jobs started by bake inside neuro platform. ([#320](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/320))

- Add tags to remote executor jobs. The tags are: "project:project_id", "flow:flow_name", "bake:bake_id",
  "remote_executor". ([#321](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/321))

- Print name of the action in error about unexpected needs entry, for example:
  ```
  ERROR: Action 'ws:some_action' does not contain task 'wrong_task_name'
  ``` ([#323](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/323))

- Added printing of filename in expression evaluation errors. ([#324](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/324))

- Dropped `outputs.needs` in batch actions. Made all action task results available for calculation action needs.
  This avoids confusing behavior when action can succeed even when some of its tasks have failed. ([#325](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/325))

- Add support of empty list and dict (`[]` and `{}`) in expressions. ([#333](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/333))

- Added validation of tasks `needs` property. ([#334](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/334))

- Added validation of action arguments before starting a bake. ([#336](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/336))

- Implemented marking of bake as failed when an error happens during the batch execution. If the error is caused
  because of SIGINT, the bake will be marked as cancelled instead of failed. ([#338](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/338))

- Allow to specify timeout for executor job in yaml and increase default lifespan to 7d. Example:
  ```
  kind: batch
  life_span: 30d
  tasks:
	...
  ``` ([#339](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/339))

- Add support of local actions inside of batch actions if they do not depend on any remote tasks. ([#340](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/340))
