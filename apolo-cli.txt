# Apolo SDK/CLI 24.12.1 (2024-12-16)

### Features

- Balance is no longer stored on a cluster level, and was moved to an organization level, e.g.,
  to an org itself, and to an org users, instead of a cluster / cluster users.

  New commands:
	- `apolo admin set-org-defaults` - allows to set an organization default values, such as a default user credits

  Existing commands changes:
	- `apolo admin add-cluster-user` cmd is no longer accepting a `credits` argument.
	- `apolo admin set-user-credits` cmd is now expecting an org name instead of a cluster name.
	- `apolo admin add-user-credits` cmd is now expecting an org name instead of a cluster name.
	- `apolo admin set-org-cluster-credits` was removed in a favor of an `apolo admin set-org-credits`.
	- `apolo admin add-org-cluster-credits` was removed in a favor of an `apolo admin add-org-credits`. ([#3137](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-cli/issues/3137))

  - `neuro admin add-org <org_name>`     Create a new org.
  - `neuro admin remove-org <org_name>`  Drop a org. Removes all memberships, very dangerous operation.

- Option `-c`/`--credits` in `neuro admin set-user-credits` and `neuro admin add-user-credits` is now required. Pass "unlimited" in `neuro admin set-user-credits` for setting no limit. Values "infinity", "nan" etc are now rejected. ([#2454](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2454))
- Added support of organizations.

  Current organization is displayed in `neuro config show`. It can be changed using `neuro config switch-org`. To least
  organizations you have access to in each cluster, use `neuro config get-clusters`.

  Also you can run job on behalf of organization. By default, `neuro run` will use current organization, but you
  can override it using `neuro run --org <some_org>`. ([#2465](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2465))

Neuro SDK/CLI 21.8.30 (2021-08-30)
==================================

Features
--------

- Implement URI autocompletion for "blob:" scheme. ([#2273](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2273))
- Provide `pip install neuro-cli[awscli,boto3]` extra dependencies for installing the compatible AWS CLI version.

  * `neuro-cli[awscli]` installs `awscli` package.

  * `neuro-cli[boto3]` installs `boto3` package.

  * `neuro-cli[awscli,boto3]` installs both. ([#2274](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2274))


Neuro SDK/CLI 21.8.27 (2021-08-27)
==================================

Features
--------

- Add support of minio provider as a bucket blob for onprem clusters ([#2271](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2271))


Bugfixes
--------

- Relax aiobotocore requirement; it allows working with the latest aiobotocore without publishing new Neuro SDK. ([#2270](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2270))


Neuro SDK/CLI 21.8.26 (2021-08-26)
==================================

Features
--------

- Add option `--since` in command `neuro logs`. Add parameter *since* in jobs.monitor(). ([#1964](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/1964))
- Add option `--timestamps` in command `neuro logs`. Add parameter *timestamps* in jobs.monitor(). ([#2252](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2252))
- Implement public URI helpers. ([#2253](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2253))
- Reworked blob storage support:

  Bucket management commands:
  - use `neuro blob mkbucket` to create new bucket
  - use `neuro blob lsbucket` to list your buckets
  - use `neuro blob statbucket <bucket_id>` to retrieve info about single bucket
  - use `neuro blob rmbucket <bucket_id>` to delete bucket. Note that you can only delete empty buckets.

  Users can name buckets objects. The name should be unique between users buckets and can be used
  instead of bucket id.

  Bucket contents management commands:
  - use `neuro blob ls blob:<bucket_id>/<path_in_bucket>` to list bucket contents. Option `-r`
  disables file system emulation and displays all keys that start with <path_in_bucket>.
  - use `neuro blob glob blob:<bucket_id>/<glob_pattern>` to glob search objects in buckets.
  For example, `blob:my_bucket/**/*.txt` pattern will match all `.txt` files in `my_bucket`
  bucket.
  - use `neuro blob cp <src_uri> <dst_uri>` to copy data from/to bucket.
  - use `neuro blob rm blob:<bucket_id>/<path_in_bucket>` to delete elements from bucket. ([#2258](https://github.com/neuro-inc/platform-client-python/issues/2258))

- The behavior of the `neuro storage cp` is now closer to the behavior of the `cp` command.
